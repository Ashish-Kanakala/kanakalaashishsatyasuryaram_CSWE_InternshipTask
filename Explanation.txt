Title:
Drone Telemetry Simulation – CSWE Internship Task

Content:-
 
I built a Python program that simulates real-time drone telemetry.

The program displays altitude, speed, battery percentage, and GPS coordinates.

Telemetry values update every 1 second for a duration of 30 seconds.

Altitude gradually increases to simulate ascent.

Speed fluctuates randomly within a realistic range.

Battery percentage decreases over time to represent power consumption.

GPS coordinates change slightly to simulate movement.

Python was chosen due to its simplicity and fast execution.
